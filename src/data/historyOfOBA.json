  "introduction": [
    "It was  Rev. Napier Clavering who encouraged the forming of the Old Boys Association at Trinity College.  As the school grew from a mere 50 students in 1872 to 458 students in 1893, in 1892, the Principal requested the Old boys to form an Association.",
    "It is said that the preliminary meeting of the Old Boys Association was held in December 1892 in the Principals Bungalow. The Principal was made the President of the association while Mr. J.H. Sproule was made the Vice-President, and Mr. J.W. Wirakoon, the Secretary and Treasurer. A sub committee was appointed to draft the rules  which was circulated among the members.",
    "The first general meeting was to be held in January 1893 but the meeting was not held until 12th of  August 1893. The programme for the meeting included a Cricket match, Tiffin, followed by the general meeting and an evening service.",
    "Since the inception of the OBA and until 1900 Rev. Napier Clavering was the President of the OBA.  The Principal of the school held this position from then onwards until 1917. In 1918  for the first time an old boy of the school Mr. T.B.L. Moonamale was made President and he remained as President until 1924.",
    "Thereafter it was always an old boy that held this prestigious position.",
    "In August 1922 the OBA celebrated the Jubilee at which time the foundation stone of the chapel was also laid.",
    "This year 2017, the OBA celebrates its 125th anniversary. "
